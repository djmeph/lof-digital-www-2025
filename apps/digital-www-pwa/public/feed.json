Then you’ll be guided through a series of gentle, floor-based, seated or standing exercises to help you tune into your body, soften chronic holding patterns, and restore fluid, easeful motion.\r\nWhether you’re working through pain, recovering from overexertion, or simply want to feel more at home in your body, this workshop will leave you grounded, open, and reconnected. It’s also great for dancers, flow artists, and movers looking to increase mobility and coordination by letting go of unnecessary tension.\r\nCome once or return each day- each session builds and deepens. No experience needed. Just bring your body, breath, and maybe a towel or blanket to lay on.",

Costumes encouraged: past lives, future paws, space cats, or time-traveling tabbies, or just a pair of shorts will do. Whether you’re a speed demon or a chill cheetah, all timelines converge at the finish line. Meow is the moment! We will meet at the greeters, do two laps around the lake and finish back at the greeter's station. This is not a race, and this event will not qualify you for the Boston Marathon, so take your time -- literally and figuratively. Afterward, join us to go hunt coffee and brunch, or head home for a cat nap.",

Healing your soul and life takes on new meaning.  Connecting on a soul level is part of the miracle of our Earthwalk. \r\n\r\nI learned this while studying Shamanism. Most of us feel something is missing in our lives at one time or another.  Either that, or we simply do not feel we are truly in our lives or body.  In Shamanism, the overwhelming focus, then, turns to soul loss.  When we undergo trauma, major trauma or minor trauma, our soul can split and part of us can leave (dissociation).  We experience this as a loss of energy and power, with all its attending manifestations: anxiety, depression, addiction, feelings of isolation, aloneness, general lack of energy and enthusiasm, and/or the resulting physical manifestations of a variety of autoimmune disorders or disease. \r\n\r\nI’ve found that one soul-retrieval session can accomplish what may take many years to heal employing psychotherapy. This is because the soul-retrieval journey involves renegotiating obsolete soul contracts and discarding limiting beliefs. In addition, the language of the soul is very different from what we use in therapy and counseling. It’s rich in image, myth, archetypes, and mystery; full of poetry and magic, it speaks to intuition and love. \r\n\r\nIn indigenous societies, the Shaman is then tasked with journeying into the spirit world (Underworld) to retrieve those lost soul pieces. \r\n\r\nAfter Shamans perform a soul retrieval, they also teach you how to do this work for yourself.  \r\n\r\nYou will learn:  \r\n-  How to retrieve those lost soul pieces\r\n-  Once realized and retrieved, how to nurture them and keep them to bring us back fully into our lives\r\n-  How to help make us whole again so that we may move forward in loving harmony ",

Got auntie-level mac and cheese? A legendary mango salsa? We want it. Just label it clearly (allergens, dietary details, and whether it contains regret or raisins), watch over it like it’s your last cold LaCroix, and clean up when it’s gone.\r\n\r\nExpect DJs from across the Lake keeping the soundtrack just right, beach lounging, spontaneous dance circles, and at least one moment that makes you say, \"Damn, I needed this.\" We’re also gathering for a big, beautiful BIPOC group photo during or after the cookout - come through, camera-ready or not.  Even if your tank top's inside out and your dignity’s still recovering from Thursday night.\r\n\r\nThis gathering is by and for people of color. Allies are welcome with care, humility, and a clear understanding: this space centers POC joy, rest, and connection. No hair-touching. No weird questions. No exceptions.\r\n\r\nBring sunscreen.

This installation features clocks gracefully surrendering to their own temporal nature, their forms melting and shifting in a beautiful dissolution.\n\nThese aren't instruments to tell the hour, but rather a visual paradox. They embody time as a human-made construct that relentlessly dictates our lives, yet paradoxically, holds no ultimate dominion beyond our individual perception. As you encounter these fluid forms, consider the profound freedom in realizing time's ultimate fluidity and its subjective grip.\n\nWitness the unraveling of the clock and perhaps find your own moment outside of \"when.\" Let's ignore the question of what time is it, and simply be here now, embracing the immediacy of this very moment."
